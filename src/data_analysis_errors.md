Here's some things that can go wrong when you analyze data:
 
*   Experimental errors: The experiment that the dataset was collected from was
    biased somehow. For example, in a voluntary survey, people who volunteer
    for the survey may hold stronger opinions about the survey topic than an
    average person.

*   Data errors: The dataset has observations that were not recorded correctly.
    For example, when the dataset was created, maybe the author accidentally
    typed "1000" instead of "100" for some observations.

*   Programming errors: Your code has a bug that causes it to produce incorrect
    results. This kind of error is easy to miss if you don't understand and
    test each line of your code.

*   Statistical errors: You use an inappropriate statistical method, or the
    assumptions are unrealistic/not satisfied.

*   Interpretation errors: You misinterpret the results of your analysis, or
    you overstate the strength your conclusions.

*   Confounding: Your analysis does not consider some feature (which might not
    even be in the dataset) that has an important effect on the result. For
    example, the wage gap for women versus men differs between industries.
    Ignoring industry could confound the results, leading you to under- or
    overstate the wage gap.

These problems are important to think about any time you do data analysis.
